===Coaltown - Computer Crash (Advanced)===

==Mission Notes==
	-	A class limit of ONE is applied to the Medic, Spy and Heavy.
	-	For all but the final two waves, the bomb hatch is sealed until certain enemies are defeated within the wave.
	-	The bomb hatch is defended by various robots, but only one hatch guardian will physically block the deployment of the bomb.
	-	The stage for this mission is littered with sentries; not every single one needs to be cleared, but the right flank needs to be 
		accessible to the team, and the bomb hatch needs to be accessible to the deploying combo.
			-	Long range classes with no falloff are best suited to this - Soldiers and Snipers are prime examples.
			-	Although Spy has the ability to deal with some sentries, it is heavily restricted due to being only able to sap one target at once.
			-	It's worth noting the sentries are generally the worst source of knockback on this map, but in particular level 2 sentries deal the most knockback.
	
==Strategy Notes==
	-	Recommended 6-man class roster: Medic, Heavy, Scout, Spy, Soldier, Sniper?
		-	A Medic is highly recommended for this mission as Quick-Fix Charges prevent knockback whilst deploying the bomb.
			-	Uber canteen specialist is very useful for simply progressing waves as they are comparable in price to respawning but also take far less time
			- 	Projectile shield is also an unignorable source of incoming damage prevention, as it can take infinite damage without any knockback being inflicted while active
		-	A Heavy is a fairly no-brainer recommendation for their high and consistent damage output when considering destroying both Giants and normal robots.
			-	The Gloves of Running Urgently are the standard for progressing quickly
			-	In addition, Heavy's high health pool make him an excellent backup choice for deploying the bomb.
				-	The Fists of Steel are a good option for planting the bomb without an ubercharge
		-	A Scout is recommended as the de-facto bomb deployer - once the wave is in a clearable state, the Medic should pocket the Scout they are capable at moving at
			high speed, increasing the useful duration of the Medic's uber (as they can cover more ground to the hatch than any other class).
			-	It may be worth substituting a Scout with a more experimental class choice, such as a Soldier who has their only focus as to rocket jump over to the hatch or a Demo with reduced push force, 
				but due to Scout's strong in-wave support (AoE Mad Milk, Cheap mini-crits with the Fan-o-War) and ability to grant the Medic increased run speed, I'd recommend Scout for deploying primarily.
			-	Do not use the Shortstop if you are deploying; it has an increased knockback taken stat.
		-	Spy instantly disposes of most of the hatch defenders making it too critical of time save to not use.
			-	You can safely dispose of non-giant hatch defenders if Your Eternal Reward is used.
				-	If you opt to use Your Eternal Reward, the Invis Watch should be used instead of the Dead Ringer as it has infinite cloak for disguises this mission.
			-	You should use the Revolver or Enforcer for the higher damage output against sentries.
		-	Soldier is a damage support choice to supplement the Heavy; they should equip the Concheror for team survivability and the Disciplinary Action to allow the Heavy to progress the wave faster
		-	Since Spy is limited to one and already preoccupied, a Hitman's Heatmaker Sniper is the next logical choice for disposing of Giants.
			-	One could also run double Soldier and shuffle upgrades around elsewhere to make use of a double banner setup.

==General Wave Progression==
- Begin wave; Scout (or whoever the deployer will be) should take the bomb after friendly AI drops it.
- Progress quickly up the right flank; the Sniper or Soldier should destroy the sentries immediately visible in that region.
- Spy should immediately move to the bomb hatch ahead of the team.
	- The hatch guardian's hitbox can be targeted outside of the shield and should be taken care of first, as it will turn around more if you sap first.
	- After this, the rest of the time should be spent dismantling sentries to reduce incoming damage against the deploying combo
- The rest of the team should progress together, utilising a combo of Projectile Shield, Ubercharge, The Concheror and Mad Milk to avoid dying.
- Sniper should almost always target giants while progressing through the wave; the rest of the team should use their discrection in the moment regarding what to target.
- Sniper and Scout should mark Giants as the Soldier will likely be using the Concheror, and mini-crits are invaluable to the Heavy's damage output.
- After the hatch is unlocked, the Sniper and Soldier should seek a rooftop position to remove any remaining hatch sentries.
	- Alternate position (https://i.imgur.com/2qtMcPD.png) if infeasible at the time. Sniper focuses hatch obstructions, whilst the Heavy defends the Sniper.
- Once the hatch defender is dead, the Medic should Uber-pocket the Scout and the Scout should deploy the bomb.
	- Stock uber seems capable of resisting the knockback of one or two sentries, but allowing more to be present may be committing self-sabotage.
	- Anyone else present, particularly the Spy, should attempt to draw fire from the combo

==Wave 1==
Map sentries are level 1 this wave - no sentry on roof.

- The bomb hatch unlocks after destroying 30 Demoknights.
	- The first wave of Demoknights that spawn -after- destroying the Giant Rapid Fire Demoman contains the 30th Demoknight.
	- There are 36 Demoknights total in the wave; when nearing only 6 indicated left on the HUD, the bomb deploy squad should ready themselves to close in on the hatch.
- The hatch is blocked by a single 'Large Demoman'; it is not a giant, and thus can be killed -instantly- by a Spy with no damage upgrades.

==Wave 2==
Map sentries are level 1 this wave.
Consider playing passively at the start of this wave, utilising heal effects like Mad Milk, as the enemy pyros are constant fire and will bypass Medic's projectile shields.

- The bomb hatch unlocks after destroying 3 Unload Demomen and 6 Soldiers.
	- The first wave of enemies that spawn after killing all but one pyro is comprised entirely of the enemies you need to kill.
- The hatch is blocked by a 'Pipe Fountain Demoman' - it will fire regardless of whether is detects a target is present or not, so take caution.
	- Despite its misleading appearance, it is also not a giant, and can again be killed instantly by a Spy.

==Wave 3==
Map sentries are level 2 this wave (maximum total knockback).

- The bomb hatch unlocks after destroying the first Giant Burst Fire Demoman.
	- It only spawns after the death of the first four Force-a-Nature Super Scouts.
- The hatch is blocked by a single Steel Gauntlet, and can be killed instantly by a Spy.

==Wave 4==
Map sentries are level 3 this wave (sentry rockets deal additional burst knockback that make planting a nightmare).
- The bomb hatch unlocks after destroying 8 Heavyweapons.
	- These spawn in tandem with a Giant Heavy, both spawning after most of the Rapid-Fire Laser Soldiers are dead.
- The hatch is blocked by a Giant Scout.
	- To kill this, the Spy should be using maximum damage upgrades; it should die in only two backstabs.
	
==Wave 5==
Map sentries are level 3 this wave.

- The bomb hatch is unlocked this wave.
	- With this in mind, the only enemy that needs to die is hatch defender, and the only secondary goal is to destroy the sentries surrounding the hatch.
- The hatch is blocked by a Giant Shotgun Heavy.
	- With maximum damage upgrades, it will take 5 backstabs to kill which is plenty of time for it or the sentries to take you out first; as a Spy, you must buy uber canteens.
		- Consider running at least two Spies this wave (or more if you can manage to not compromise the mission)
		- Since you can't kill the hatch guard instantly this wave, consider using the stock Knife with the Dead Ringer
- The Giant Spam Adept will lay stickies capable of knocking back anyone, take precautionary measures.

==Wave 6==
There are no map sentries this wave.
All map barriers are lifted this wave, so the fast leftside approach can be used.

- Destruction of THE CORRUPTED, a boss Giant Soldier is the winning condition for this mission.
	- It spawns on the platform behind the bomb hatch and will progress through the level towards any players.
	- It spam attacks using homing rockets and lasers, dealing blast and fire damage respectively.
		- It does not deal bullet or crit damage, so save credits when purchasing resistances
	- Recommended Class Respec
		- Scout -> Soldier
		- Spy -> Soldier
		- Sniper should also consider Soldier but is still a respectable damage pick.
		- Crit Dragon's Fury Pyro is very cheap to max damage for (higher dps than phlog) and Pyro will provide the Huo-Long Heater buff if required.
	- Recommended Item Respec
		- Medigun -> Kritzkrieg
			- This boss can be ubersawed to build Kritzkrieg charge quickly.
		- Rocket Launcher or Direct Hit -> Beggar's Bazooka or Air Strike
			- Beggar's Bazooka: The accuracy required to take down enemies at a range is no longer requried, so the increased DPS is preferred.
			- Air Strike: If you already have sufficient banner buffs, you get a rough total of $6500 credits throughout the mission, making this a viable damage choice.
		- Minigun -> Brass Beast or Huo-Long Heater
			- The boss is not very mobile once engaged.
	- You should max crit canteens for this wave.
